Turn In

__What is this?__
=================

Keeping a log of things to actually show to Hannah. Basically to keep us organized. Keeping the list up to date with the dates that a work check is required! Check off list items when they are turned in as to not repeat items.

Things to show to Hannah:
-------------------------
1. Icon Design Ideas (paper sketches)
2. Font Scan
3. Repo (THIS!)
4. Any Photoshop Files
